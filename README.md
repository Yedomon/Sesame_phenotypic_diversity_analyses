The present repository contained two folders corresponding to the [data](https://github.com/Yedomon/Sesame_phenotypic_diversity_analyses/tree/main/data) sets and the [R codes](https://github.com/Yedomon/Sesame_phenotypic_diversity_analyses/tree/main/code).


The R scripts are organized as follows:


#### [01. Data diagnosis and descriptive statistics](https://github.com/Yedomon/Sesame_phenotypic_diversity_analyses/blob/main/code/01_Data_diagnosis_and_descriptive_statistics.R)

#### [02. Boxplot representation of the quantitative data](https://github.com/Yedomon/Sesame_phenotypic_diversity_analyses/blob/main/code/02_Boxplot_script.R)

#### [03. Pie chart representation of the qualitative data](https://github.com/Yedomon/Sesame_phenotypic_diversity_analyses/blob/main/code/03_Pie_chart.R)

#### [04. Diversity index calculation](https://github.com/Yedomon/Sesame_phenotypic_diversity_analyses/blob/main/code/04_diversity_index_script.R)
